# Raspberry-Pi-Powered-CCTV-Security-System
This project implements the Raspberry Pi CCTV surveillance system with the additional feature  of Saving the Video in a read/write ­able format.The camera module utilised in this project is  manufactured and distributed by Raspberry Pi Foundation connected to the Raspberry Pi Board. The WiFi USB Adapter is attached to this system for the wireless transmission of data  from the CCTV to the shared memory folder for remote monitoring purpose.  Purpose behind this project :    Raspberry Pi CCTV with the integration of Raspberry Pi Camera Module is a very  economically viable and true to it’s standard, surveillance system which can easily replace the  bulky CCTV surveillance systems which costs high.    Raspberry Pi can be widely customised and is thus very flexible. From HD surveillance to  motion­detect features, the system is light in hardware and can be made undetectable without  lowering its power which gives high security and safety by providing video streams from the  camera.    Raspberry Pi with the Raspbian Operating System helps in building the CCTV system in a user  friendly process. The wireless video storage capability using the WiFi USB Adapter appends to  the benefit of saving the video from the Camera to any memory storage disk or SD cards which  makes it highly portable. The video saving capability helps the user to keep a check on the  property as well as help him take precautions by analysing the data.
